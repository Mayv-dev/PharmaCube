If the motor stops spinning (as well as 3 lights on the driver), a known solution is:
 - switch off the power
 - unplug the motor from the driver board (it's the white plug)
 - reconnect the power and run main.py
 - ensure the lights are either all lit up or only lit up in 2s.
 - reconnect the motor
